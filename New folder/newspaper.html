                <h3>Tiger</h3>
                <p>Tigers are among the most majestic creatures in the animal kingdom. From the white tiger and the Royal Bengal tiger to the Siberian tiger, these wild cats encompass various species, each ruling their habitat with pride. However, factors such as climate change, illegal wildlife trade, and habitat loss have caused the tiger population to shrink rapidly.
